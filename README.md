## About the Video Course
With the major release of Unreal Engine 4, Epic Games has registered its presence in the world of Virtual Reality. Following the release of such popular product launches as Oculus, HTC Vive, Samsung Gear, and more, VR has gained a lot of ground and is a booming industry today. 
In this volume we are going to create a Shooter game in VR by learning variations in movement and interaction techniques and by creating dummy enemies. Next we explore how to create UI elements for VR games while learning about optimization techniques and where we can distribute our VR application. We will look at SDKs that support your preferred hardware, and the different engines that you can use to create Virtual Reality content while understanding their strengths and weaknesses. Moving on, you'll learn how to boost the performance of your VR apps by profiling, rendering, and setting up your VR kits. By the end, you will have created a VR game and developed a comprehensive VR experience using Unreal.
